```

All files are ready for the **watcher process** to:
1. Extract text content
2. Classify into categories (Education/Technology/Programming)
3. Split into 600-character chunks
4. Index into ChromaDB

---

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Monitor Processing
Check that watcher has processed files:
```
Watcher logs should show:
- [text extraction] Loading file: ML_Neural_Networks.txt
- [classification] → Category: Education
- [chunking] → 150-200 chunks created
- [indexing] → Added to ChromaDB
```

### Step 2: Simple Retrieval Tests (Warm-up)
Ask basic factual questions first:

**Test Q1**: "What is the purpose of activation functions?"
**Expected**: Retrieved from ML_Neural_Networks.txt, mentions non-linearity

**Test Q2**: "What does the Single Responsibility Principle mean?"
**Expected**: Retrieved from Software_Architecture.txt, describes SRP

**Test Q3**: "What HTTP method creates a new resource?"
**Expected**: Retrieved from REST_API_Design.txt, mentions POST and 201

### Step 3: Intermediate Retrieval Tests (Moderate difficulty)
Ask questions requiring multiple facts:

**Test Q4**: "Compare RNN and CNN. When use each?"
**Expected**: Retrieved from ML_Neural_Networks.txt, contrasts architectures

**Test Q5**: "Explain the N+1 query problem and its solution"
**Expected**: Retrieved from Database_Design.txt, explains problem and JOIN solution

### Step 4: Advanced Integration Tests (Full RAG validation)
Ask questions requiring information from multiple documents:

**Test Q6**: "Design a secure REST API for uploading machine learning models"
**Expected**: Combines:
- REST_API_Design.txt (endpoints, status codes, authentication)
- ML_Neural_Networks.txt (model types, input validation)
- Cybersecurity_Guide.txt (file validation, encryption, rate limiting)

## Expected System Behavior

### Successful Response Example:
```
User: "What is the difference between PUT and PATCH in REST APIs?"

DocuMind AI Response:
"PUT replaces the entire resource (all fields required), while PATCH 
performs a partial update (only specified fields updated). PUT is 
idempotent; PATCH may not be.

This pattern allows flexibility in API design. For example, updating 
a user profile where PUT requires all fields (name, email, role) while 
PATCH only requires the fields being changed (just role to 'moderator').

Sources:
- REST_API_Design.txt: HTTP Methods section (comparison table)
- REST_API_Design.txt: Request Examples (PUT vs PATCH examples)"
```

### Expected Chunks Retrieved:
- 3-5 relevant chunks from REST_API_Design.txt
- Distance scores < 1.5 (high similarity)
- Chunks ordered by similarity score

### Edge Cases to Test:

**Case 1**: "How do Transformers work?"
- Expected: ML_Neural_Networks.txt
- Actual: Should NOT pull from Architecture guide
- Validation: Source attribution must be specific

**Case 2**: "What is SQL injection?"
- Expected: Cybersecurity_Guide.txt with examples
- Actual: Should NOT give general definitions from other docs
- Validation: Code examples must be from security guide

**Case 3**: "Design a complete database and API"
- Expected: Integration of Database_Design.txt + REST_API_Design.txt
- Actual: Should combine relevant patterns from both
- Validation: Multi-source response with clear section attribution

## Notes for Effective Testing

1. **Ask Naturally**: Use conversational language, don't quote documentation
2. **Mix Topics**: Randomize questions to prevent caching bias
3. **Vary Difficulty**: Progress from easy → hard to see degradation patterns
4. **Note Edge Cases**: Track questions that fail or perform poorly
5. **Monitor Logs**: Check watcher/app logs for processing/retrieval details
6. **Validate Sources**: Confirm system cites correct documents
7. **Test Corrections**: Try asking again if response is incomplete
